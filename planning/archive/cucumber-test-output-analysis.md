# Cucumber Test Output Analysis and Issues

## Overview
Analysis of excessive test output noise and API session creation failures in RFH cucumber test suite.

## Current Test Status
- **Total Scenarios**: 66 scenarios 
- **Passing**: ~57 scenarios (recent run)
- **Main Issues**: API session creation failures, excessive error output noise

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. API Error 500 "Failed to create session"
**Frequency**: Very high - appears throughout test execution
**Location**: `internal/api/auth_handlers.go:117`
**Root Cause**: Session creation failure in `s.DB.CreateUserSession()`

```
Error: login failed: API error (500): Failed to create session
```

**Analysis**:
- Occurs during `loginHandler()` when creating user session in database
- Suggests database connection issues or constraint violations
- High frequency suggests race conditions during concurrent test execution
- May be related to `user_sessions` table schema or constraints

**Impact**: Prevents successful login authentication in many test scenarios

### 2. Excessive Error Output Noise
**Problem**: Expected error messages are cluttering test output, making real failures hard to identify

**Examples of Noise**:
```
Error: registry 'nonexistent' not found
Error: no active registry configured  
Error: login failed: API error (500): Failed to create session
Error: file must be a valid .mdc file: test-rule.txt
Error: accepts 1 arg(s), received 0
Error: failed to read input
Error: no staged archives found
```

**Analysis**: These are expected errors from negative test cases but are being displayed as if they're unexpected failures.

### 3. File Extension Validation Issues
**Problem**: `.mdc` files being rejected as invalid during test package creation

```
Error: file must be a valid .mdc file: rules.mdc
Warning: Failed to publish test packages: Pack failed for security-rules
```

**Analysis**:
- `setupTestData()` method in World class failing to create valid test packages
- `publishPackage()` method may not be creating properly formatted `.mdc` files
- Affects downstream tests that depend on published packages (like add command tests)

### 4. Test Package Publishing Failures
**Location**: `cucumber-testing/features/support/world.js` - `setupTestData()` method
**Problem**: Test setup fails to publish required packages for add command tests

**Impact**: Cascading failures in tests that expect certain packages to be available

## Affected Test Categories

### High Impact
- **Authentication tests**: Session creation failures
- **Add command tests**: Missing test packages
- **Publish tests**: File validation issues

### Medium Impact  
- **Registry management**: Output noise makes debugging difficult
- **Pack command**: File validation edge cases

## Technical Investigation Details

### Database Session Creation (auth_handlers.go:115-118)
```go
session, err := s.DB.CreateUserSession(user.ID, tokenHash, expiresAt, &userAgent, &ipAddress)
if err != nil {
    writeError(w, http.StatusInternalServerError, "Failed to create session")
    return
}
```

### File Validation Issue
- CLI expects `.mdc` files but test setup may not be creating valid content
- `isValidMdcFile()` function may have strict validation rules not met by test files

### World Class Test Setup
```javascript
async setupTestData() {
    await this.ensureRegistrySetup();
    
    // Publish test packages that are expected by the tests
    try {
        await this.publishPackage('security-rules', '1.0.1', '# Security Rules v1.0.1\n\nTest security rules for testing purposes.');
        await this.publishPackage('example-rules', '0.1.0', '# Example Rules v0.1.0\n\nTest example rules for testing purposes.');
        console.log('Test packages published successfully');
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn(`Warning: Failed to publish test packages: ${error.message}`);
        // Don't throw - tests might still work if packages are already on server
    }
}
```

## Proposed Solutions

### Priority 1: Fix API Session Creation
- Investigate database schema for `user_sessions` table
- Add detailed error logging to identify root cause
- Check for race conditions in concurrent test execution
- Implement connection pooling or retry logic if needed

### Priority 2: Reduce Output Noise
- Modify World class `runCommand()` method to support quiet mode
- Add `expectError: true` option to suppress expected error output
- Update test step definitions to use quiet mode for negative test cases
- Preserve error output only for unexpected failures

### Priority 3: Fix File Validation
- Update `publishPackage()` method to create properly formatted `.mdc` files
- Ensure test files pass CLI validation requirements
- Fix `setupTestData()` to successfully create test packages
- Add validation checks for file content structure

### Priority 4: Improve Test Reliability
- Add better error handling in test setup methods  
- Implement fallback strategies for package publishing failures
- Add pre-test validation to ensure required packages exist
- Improve isolation between test scenarios

## Files to Modify

### Core Files
- `cucumber-testing/features/support/world.js` - Test setup and command execution
- `internal/api/auth_handlers.go` - Session creation error handling
- `internal/cli/pack.go` - File validation logic (investigate)

### Test Files
- Various step definition files to add quiet mode support
- Feature files may need expected error message updates

## Success Metrics
- Reduce test output noise by 80%+
- Eliminate "Failed to create session" errors
- Achieve successful test package publishing
- Improve test reliability and debugging experience
- Maintain current passing test count while fixing underlying issues

## Notes
- This analysis was conducted after successful removal of `--add-to-existing` flag
- Current baseline is stable with clean pack command functionality
- Focus should be on reliability improvements without breaking existing functionality
