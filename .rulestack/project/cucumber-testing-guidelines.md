# Cucumber Testing Guidelines

This rule provides guidance for writing maintainable and reliable Cucumber tests for the RFH project.

## Test Reliability Rules

### Never Test Verbose Output
**NEVER** write Cucumber scenarios that test `--verbose` flag output or debug information.

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Add with verbose output
  When I run "rfh add example-rules@0.1.0 --verbose" in the project directory
  Then I should see "RFH version: 1.0.0"
  And I should see "üì¶ Adding package: example-rules@0.1.0"
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Add existing package successfully
  When I run "rfh add example-rules@0.1.0" in the project directory
  Then I should see "‚úÖ Successfully added example-rules@0.1.0"
  And the command should exit with zero status
```

**Rationale:** Verbose output is for debugging and can change frequently during development. Testing it creates brittle tests that fail when debug output formatting changes.

### Use Enhanced World Setup Functions

**ALWAYS** use the enhanced World setup functions instead of manual configuration when writing step definitions.

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given RFH is installed and accessible
  And I have a clean config file
  And I have a registry "test-registry" configured at "http://localhost:8081"
  And "test-registry" is the active registry
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```gherkin
Background:
  Given RFH is installed and accessible
  And the test registry is configured
  And test packages are available
  And I am logged in as root
```

## Available Enhanced World Function

### Registry and Authentication Setup
- `Given the test registry is configured` - Sets up test registry at localhost:8081 with root authentication
- `Given test packages are available` - Publishes standard test packages (security-rules@1.0.1, example-rules@0.1.0)
- `Given I am logged in as root` - Authenticates as root user for write operations
- `Given I am logged in as a user` - Creates and authenticates as test user for read-only operations
- `Given I am logged in as a user named {string}` - Creates and authenticates as specific named user

### Package Management
- `Given package {string} version {string} is published` - Publishes a specific test package
- `Then package {string} version {string} should exist` - Verifies package exists via API
- `Then I should be authenticated as {string}` - Verifies current authentication state
- `Then the registry should be configured for testing` - Verifies registry setup

## When to Use Manual Setup vs Enhanced World

### Use Enhanced World When:
- Testing package operations (add, publish)
- Testing authentication flows that need existing packages
- Testing features that require a working registry setup
- Writing new step definitions for package-related features

### Use Manual Setup When:
- Testing registry management commands themselves (add, remove, list registries)
- Testing error conditions for missing registries
- Testing authentication failures
- Testing initialization commands that don't need registry setup

## Step Definition Writing Guidelines

### Registry Configuration
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - Manual registry setup in step definitions
Given('I have a registry configured', async function () {
  await this.runCommand('rfh registry add test http://localhost:8081');
  await this.runCommand('rfh registry use test');
});

// ‚úÖ Good - Use enhanced World method
Given('I have a registry configured', async function () {
  await this.ensureRegistrySetup();
});
```

### User Authentication
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - Manual authentication
Given('I am authenticated as root', async function () {
  await this.runCommand('rfh auth login --username root --password root1234');
});

// ‚úÖ Good - Use enhanced World method
Given('I am authenticated as root', async function () {
  await this.loginAsRoot();
});
```

### Package Setup
```javascript
// ‚ùå Bad - Manual package publishing
Given('packages exist for testing', async function () {
  // Complex manual package creation and publishing logic
});

// ‚úÖ Good - Use enhanced World method
Given('packages exist for testing', async function () {
  await this.setupTestData();
});
```

## Test Structure Guidelines

### Feature Background
Keep backgrounds simple and focused:
```gherkin
Background:
  Given RFH is installed and accessible
  And the test registry is configured
  And test packages are available
  And I am logged in as root
```

### Scenario Independence
Each scenario should be independent and not rely on side effects from other scenarios. The enhanced World provides fresh state for each scenario.

## State Management and Test Isolation Rules

### Always Use RFH Commands for State Management
**ALWAYS** prefer using RFH commands to set up and tear down test conditions rather than manually manipulating config files or using external tools.

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```javascript
Given('I have no registries configured', async function () {
  // Manually delete config file
  await fs.remove(this.configPath);
  // Or set configPath to nonexistent location
  this.configPath = '/nonexistent/path/config.toml';
});
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```javascript
Given('I have a clean config file with no registries', async function () {
  // Use RFH commands to properly reset state
  await this.resetConfig();
  this.configPath = path.join(this.testConfigDir, 'config.toml');
});
```

### Create Reusable State Management Functions in World.js
When multiple tests need the same state setup or cleanup, create reusable methods in the World class rather than duplicating logic in step definitions.

**‚ùå Bad Example:**
```javascript
// In step definitions - duplicated logic
Given('I have a clean registry state', async function () {
  await this.runCommand('rfh auth logout');
  await this.runCommand('rfh registry list');
  const output = this.lastCommandOutput;
  // Complex parsing and cleanup logic repeated everywhere
});
```

**‚úÖ Good Example:**
```javascript
// In world.js - reusable method
async resetConfig() {
  await this.runCommand('rfh auth logout');
  await this.runCommand('rfh registry list');
  const registryNames = this.parseRegistryNames(this.lastCommandOutput);
  for (const name of registryNames) {
    await this.runCommand(`rfh registry remove ${name}`);
  }
  this.registryConfigured = false;
  this.currentUser = null;
}

// In step definitions - simple call
Given('I have a clean config file with no registries', async function () {
  await this.resetConfig();
});
```

### Avoid Shared State Between Tests
Tests should never depend on state left behind by previous tests. Always reset to a known clean state at the beginning of scenarios that need specific conditions.

**‚ùå Bad Pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Setup registry
  When I run "rfh registry add test-reg http://example.com"
  
Scenario: Use existing registry  # ‚ùå Depends on previous scenario
  When I run "rfh auth login --username test --password pass"
  Then I should see "Logging in to http://example.com"
```

**‚úÖ Good Pattern:**
```gherkin
Scenario: Setup registry
  When I run "rfh registry add test-reg http://example.com"
  
Scenario: Login with configured registry
  Given I have a clean config file with no registries  # ‚úÖ Reset state
  And I have a registry "test-reg" configured at "http://example.com"
  When I run "rfh auth login --username test --password pass" 
  Then I should see "Logging in to http://example.com"
```

### Prefer Reset Over Failure
When a test fails due to incorrect state from a previous run, the solution is to improve state management, not to accept the failure.

**Problem Indicators:**
- Tests pass individually but fail when run in sequence
- Tests show unexpected registry/auth state
- Error messages reference configs from previous tests

**Solution Approach:**
1. Identify what state is being shared incorrectly
2. Create or improve World methods to properly reset that state
3. Use those methods in step definitions that need clean state
4. Verify tests pass both individually and in sequence

### State Management Function Patterns

```javascript
// Pattern: Reset functions that use RFH commands
async resetConfig() {
  // Use RFH commands to clean up
  await this.runCommand('rfh auth logout');
  const registries = await this.getRegistryList();
  for (const registry of registries) {
    await this.runCommand(`rfh registry remove ${registry}`);
  }
  // Reset internal flags
  this.resetInternalState();
}

// Pattern: Setup functions that use RFH commands  
async ensureRegistrySetup() {
  if (!this.registryConfigured) {
    await this.runCommand('rfh registry add test-registry http://localhost:8081');
    await this.runCommand('rfh registry use test-registry');
    await this.loginAsRoot();
    this.registryConfigured = true;
  }
}

// Pattern: Parsing helpers for RFH command output
parseRegistryNames(listOutput) {
  // Parse RFH command output into usable data
  if (listOutput.includes('No registries configured')) return [];
  // Handle actual format from 'rfh registry list'
  return extractedNames;
}
```

### Error Testing
When testing error conditions, be specific about what you're testing:
```gherkin
# ‚úÖ Good - Tests specific error condition
Scenario: Add package with no registry configured
  Given I have a clean config file with no registries
  When I run "rfh add some-package@1.0.0"
  Then I should see "no registry configured"
```

## Help Text Testing

It's acceptable to verify that help text mentions verbose flags, as this tests the CLI interface:
```gherkin
# ‚úÖ OK - Testing help text content
Then I should see "-v, --verbose"
```

But never test the actual verbose output behavior.

Following these guidelines will result in more maintainable, reliable cucumber tests that focus on testing actual functionality rather than debug output formatting.
