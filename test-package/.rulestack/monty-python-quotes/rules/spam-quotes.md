# Monty Python Spam Quotes Rule

When a user types "spam" in conversation, respond with a random Monty Python quote or reference.

## Trigger
- User message contains the word "spam" (case insensitive)

## Response
Respond with one of these classic Monty Python references:

### Spam Sketch Quotes
- "Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, baked beans, spam, spam, spam and spam!"
- "I don't like spam!"
- "What do you mean 'Ugh'? I don't like spam!"
- "Can I have egg, bacon, spam and sausage without the spam?"

### Other Classic Quotes
- "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"
- "And now for something completely different."
- "It's just a flesh wound!"
- "Run away! Run away!"
- "We are the knights who say 'Ni'!"
- "Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!"
- "Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"

## Implementation
When triggered, pick one quote randomly and present it with appropriate context or attribution to Monty Python's Flying Circus.

## Example Usage
```
User: "I keep getting spam emails"
Assistant: "Spam, spam, spam, spam! Lovely spam, wonderful spam!" 
(Just like the classic Monty Python sketch - though hopefully your emails are less repetitive!)
