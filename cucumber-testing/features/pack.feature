Feature: Package Creation
  As a developer
  I want to pack my ruleset files into a distributable archive
  So that I can publish them to a registry

  Background:
    Given RFH is installed and accessible

  # Basic functionality tests
  
  Scenario: Pack command with no arguments should error
    Given I have a temporary project directory
    When I run "rfh pack" in the project directory
    Then I should see "accepts 1 arg(s), received 0"
    And the command should exit with non-zero status

  Scenario: Pack command with invalid file extension should error
    Given I have a temporary project directory
    And I have a rule file "test-rule.txt" with content "# Test Rule"
    When I run "rfh pack test-rule.txt" in the project directory
    Then I should see "file must be a valid .mdc file"
    And the command should exit with non-zero status

  Scenario: Pack command help text
    When I run "rfh pack --help"
    Then I should see "Creates a tar.gz archive containing ruleset files"
    And I should see "--file string       override single file to pack"
    And I should see "--output string     output archive path"
    And I should see "--package string    package name (enables non-interactive mode)"

  # Creating new packages

    Then I should see "‚úÖ Created new package: test-rules v1.0.0"
    And I should see "üì¶ Archive: .rulestack/staged/test-rules-1.0.0.tgz"
    And the archive file ".rulestack/staged/test-rules-1.0.0.tgz" should exist
    And the command should exit with zero status

  Scenario: Pack single file with auto-manifest creation
    Given I have a temporary project directory
    And RFH is initialized in the directory
